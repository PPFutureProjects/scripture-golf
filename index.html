        <p>Scripture Golf is a classic LDS Sunday School game. It is a game of scripture trivia.</p>

        <p>This app is intended as a fun way to learn and remember scriptures. Get some friends together, select the number of rounds you'd like to play, and start the game! You'll be presented with a scripture and must first guess the book it is in, and then the chapter it is in. Each wrong guess adds a point to your score. At the end of the game, the player with the least amount of points wins!</p>

        <p>While every effort has been made to make this app is bug-free, if you encounter any bugs or have any suggestions for future versions, please email <a href="mailto:woodruffapps@gmail.com">woodruffapps@gmail.com</a> and I will try try to be as responsive as possible. This app will continue to be supported through adding more scriptures, making changes to the app to improve performance, and adding new features.</p>

        <p>Check out the game's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ldsscripturegolf/">Facebook Page</a>!</p>
